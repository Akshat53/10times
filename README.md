# Event Creation Web Application

This is a lightweight web application that allows users to create events on the frontend and display them in a listing. The application is built using **React** and uses mock APIs to handle the event creation and listing process.

- **src/**: Contains the main source code of the application.
  - **components/**: Reusable components like `EventForm` and `EventList`.
  - **pages/**: Main pages like `CreateEvent` and `EventListing`.
  - **mock/**: Mock APIs for handling event creation and fetching events.
- **public/**: Contains static files and assets.
- **README.md**: Instructions on how to run the project.

## Features
